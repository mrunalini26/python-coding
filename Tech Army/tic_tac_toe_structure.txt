Steps:
1)designing a tic tac toe Python program 3X3 gameboard.
2)Using the Data Structure to Store Data:
The Status of Grid: For this we will create a data structure that stores the status for each cell which can be either filled or empty.

The Move of each player: it is always good to store the past and present moves of each player which are the positions occupied by 'X' and 'O'.

Best practices to follow:
1) Logging
2) Type hints.
3) Pep8 guideliness.
4) Proper comments and function documentation.
5)

	create_game
	self.board_dict = {} 
	display_board
	modify_board
	
class Player:
	Initialise_player
	
class Play :
	check_won:
		row_win(), col_win(), and diag_win() functions check whether the player has three of their marks in a horizontal row, vertical row, or diagonal row, respectively.
	change_turn
